# LadyHacks Workshop with Shopify
## Intro to HTML & CSS

In today's workshop, we'll be building a simple responsive website. The following links are examples of sites we'll be able to build by the end of the workshop:

* [Lady Hacks](https://bettymakes.github.io/yorku-ladyhacks/ladyhacks.html)
* [Shopify](https://bettymakes.github.io/yorku-ladyhacks/shopify.html)
* [Netflix](https://bettymakes.github.io/yorku-ladyhacks/netflix.html)

To get started, you will need to:

1. Download and install Subline Text 3. This is our text-editor of choice, where we'll be writing all our code today.

2. Download this project's starting code base. In order to kickstart our process, we'll all start with a baseline project.
